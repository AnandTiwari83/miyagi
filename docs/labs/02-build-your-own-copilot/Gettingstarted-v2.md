# Build Intelligent Apps with Microsoft's Copilot Stack & Azure OpenAI

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

In this lab, you will gain a strong understanding of Generative AI basics, Azure Open AI, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) patterns, Semantic Kernel, and how to utilize these concepts to create your own Copilot for your business needs. You will also explore use cases that showcase Copilot product experiences. Using Microsoft's Copilot stack and practical use cases this lab will guide you in envisioning and creating intelligent systems that integrate foundation models resulting in improved productivity and hyper-personalized product experiences.â€¯

## Objective

- **Verify and Retrieve the values of Azure Resources**: This hands-on exercise aims to verify and Retrieve the values to ensure the proper configuration and connectivity of the Azure resources.
- **Run Miyagi App Locally** : This hands-on exercise aims to configure the Miyagi App, implement the Recommendation service, deploy the frontend locally, optimize data retrieval with Azure AI Search, and explore the app and service for a personalized user experience.
- **Containerizing Miyagi UI and Recommendation service to Azure Kubernetes Service(AKS)** : This hands-on exercise aims to containerize and deploy Miyagi UI and recommendation services to AKS, configuring Kubernetes, pushing Docker images to ACR, and verifying deployment via service endpoints. 
- **Explore and Verify the Containerized Miyagi UI and Recommendation service in AKS**: This hands-on exercise aims to deploy and verify Miyagi UI and Recommendation services on AKS, testing APIs and accessing the UI through Ingress endpoints to ensure functionality. This exercise enhances understanding of managing and routing traffic within Kubernetes environments.
- **Expose Open AI through APIM**: This hands-on exercise aims to verify and create APIs in the API Management service to update the Docker image for the Recommendation service, ensuring the optimization and maintenance of containerized applications. 
- **Getting Started with Your Own Copilot**: This hands-on exercise aims to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) with languages like C#, Python, and Java by allowing the creation of easily chainable plugins. 
  
## Pre-requisites

- Understanding of Generative AI basics
- Familiarity with Azure Open AI
- Experience with Semantic Kernel

## Architecture

Miyagi's architecture uses AI for hyper-personalized user interactions, transforming applications with Semantic Kernel skills and advanced prompt engineering. It features scalable microservices and an event-driven backbone, evolving with new AI models. The frontend offers personalized experiences similar to Microsoft Copilot.

It integrates Azure Functions, AKS, and Apache Kafka for seamless communication, with data managed by Cosmos DB and Azure Storage. Miyagi exemplifies advanced AI and Azure services for future-ready, intelligent applications.

## Explanation of Components

- **Azure OpenAI**: Azure OpenAI integrates OpenAI's language models into Microsoft's Azure cloud, enabling scalable AI solutions for natural language processing and automation.
- **AI Search**: Is a cloud service that enables powerful and flexible search capabilities, including full-text search and AI-powered features.
- **Azure Functions**: Run code in response to events without managing servers. Scales automatically based on demand.
- **AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)**: Managed Kubernetes service for container orchestration and scaling.
- **Apache Kafka**: Handles real-time data streaming and event processing.
- **Cosmos DB**: Globally distributed, multi-model database with low latency and high availability.
- **Azure Storage**: Scalable storage for blobs, files, queues, and tables.
- **Bing Search**: Lets you add Bing search features to your apps. It provides APIs for web, image, video, and news searches.

# Getting Started with the Lab

1. After the environment has been set up, your browser will load a virtual machine (JumpVM), use this virtual machine throughout the workshop to perform the lab. You can see the number on the bottom of the lab guide to switch to different exercises in the lab guide.

1. To get the lab environment details, you can select the **Environment** tab. Additionally, the credentials will also be emailed to your registered email address. You can also open the Lab Guide in a separate and full window by selecting the **Split Window** from the lower right corner. Also, you can start, stop, and restart virtual machines from the **Resources** tab.
