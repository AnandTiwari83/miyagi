## Overview

In this lab, you will gain a strong understanding of Generative AI basics, Azure Open AI, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) patterns, Semantic Kernel, and how to utilize these concepts to create your own Copilot for your business needs. You will also explore use cases that showcase Copilot product experiences. Using Microsoft's Copilot stack and practical use cases this lab will guide you in envisioning and creating intelligent systems that integrate foundation models resulting in improved productivity and hyper-personalized product experiences.â€¯

## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will achieve the following:

- **Understanding Generative AI Basics**: Grasp the foundational concepts and principles of generative AI.
- **Exploring Azure OpenAI**: Learn how to leverage Azure OpenAI for various AI-driven tasks.
- **Implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Patterns**: Understand and apply RAG patterns to enhance AI model performance.
- **Utilizing Semantic Kernel**:Gain insights into the Semantic Kernel and how to use it effectively in AI solutions.
- **Creating a Custom Copilot**: Develop and customize a Copilot tailored to specific business needs.
- **Exploring Copilot Use Cases**: Investigate practical use cases that demonstrate Copilot product experiences and capabilities.
- **Integrating Foundation Models**: Envision and create intelligent systems that integrate foundation models to improve productivity and provide hyper-personalized product experiences.

## Pre-requisites

- Understanding of Generative AI basics
- Familiarity with Azure Open AI
- Experience with Semantic Kernel

## Architecture

Miyagi's architecture uses AI for hyper-personalized user interactions, transforming applications with Semantic Kernel skills and advanced prompt engineering. It features scalable microservices and an event-driven backbone, evolving with new AI models. The frontend offers personalized experiences similar to Microsoft Copilots.

It integrates Azure Functions, AKS/ACA, and Apache Kafka for seamless communication, with data managed by Cosmos DB, Azure DB for PostgreSQL, Azure Redis Cache, and Azure Storage. GitHub Actions streamlines development and deployment. Miyagi exemplifies advanced AI and Azure services for future-ready, intelligent applications.

## Getting Started with the Lab

1. After the environment has been set up, your browser will load a virtual machine (JumpVM), use this virtual machine throughout the workshop to perform the lab. You can see the number on the bottom of the lab guide to switch to different exercises in the lab guide.

1. To get the lab environment details, you can select the **Environment** tab. Additionally, the credentials will also be emailed to your registered email address. You can also open the Lab Guide in a separate and full window by selecting the **Split Window** from the lower right corner. Also, you can start, stop, and restart virtual machines from the **Resources** tab.

   > You will see the SUFFIX value on the **Environment** tab; use it wherever you see SUFFIX or DeploymentID in lab steps.
 
## Login to the Azure Portal

1. Minimize the **Docker Desktop** by click on **Minimize** button.
