# Lab 5: Getting Started with Your Own Copilot

### Estimated Duration: 30 minutes

Semantic Kernel is an SDK that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Hugging Face with conventional programming languages like C#, Python, and Java. Semantic Kernel achieves this by allowing you to define plugins that can be chained together in just a few lines of code.

What makes Semantic Kernel _special_, however, is its ability to _automatically_ orchestrate plugins with AI. With Semantic Kernel
[planners](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/planner), you can ask an LLM to generate a plan that achieves a user's unique goal. Afterwards, Semantic Kernel will execute the plan for the user.

## Lab objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Configure and Run the Semantic Kernel Sample
- Task 2: Configure Azure Cognitive Search

### Task 1: Configure and Run the Semantic Kernel Sample
In this task, you will configure the Semantic Kernel plugin in Visual Studio Code, create a C# Home Automation app using Azure OpenAI, and build and run the application to interact with it.

1. Open **Visual Studio Code** from the Lab VM desktop by double-clicking on it.

2. In the **Visual Studio Code** from the left panel select **Semantic Kernel** **(1)** plugin, expand  by click on **AIENDPONTS(OPEN AI)** **(2)**, click on **Switch EndPoint Provider** **(3)**, and select **AzureOpenAI** **(4)**.

3. Under **AI ENDPONTS(AZURE OPENAI)**, click on **sign in to Azure** **(1)**, in the pop-up  **The extension 'Semantic Kernel Tools' wants to sign in using Microsoft** click on **Allow** **(2)**.

4. This will redirect to **Microsoft login page**, select your Azure account **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>**, and navigate back to the **Visual studio code**.

5. Navigate back to the **Visual Studio Code** From the **Functions panel**, click on the **Get started icon** **(1)** and follow the wizard to **create your app** **(2)** with the semantic function.

6. Choose **C# Home Automation**

    ![](./Media/miyagi-image96.png)

7. Browse the location **C:\LabFiles** and **select location for new app**

   ![](./Media/miyagi-image97.png)

8. Click on **Yes, I trust authors**.

   ![](./Media/miyagi-image98.png)

9. Navigate to the **appsettings.json** **(1)** file and replace the existing **script** **(2)** with the following:

   ```
   {
   "AzureOpenAI": {
     "ChatDeploymentName": "",
     "Endpoint": "",
     "ApiKey": ""
      }
   }
   ```

   ![](./Media/replaceappsetting.png)

10. In ASP.NET Core, `appsettings.json` is a configuration file used to store various application settings, such as service endpoints, and other application-specific settings and save the file **Ctrl + S**. 

    | **Variables**       | **Values**                                             |
    | --------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
    | ChatDeploymentName  | **<inject key="CompletionModel" enableCopy="true"/>**  |
    | Endpoint            | **<inject key="OpenAIEndpoint" enableCopy="true"/>**   |
    | ApiKey              | **<inject key="OpenAIKey" enableCopy="true"/>**        |

11. Make sure that your `appsettings.json` file looks as shown in the below screenshot.

    ![](./Media/miyagi-image(99).png)

12. Configure an Azure OpenAI endpoint by Opening a New **Terminal** click on **(...) (1)** next to **View** menu and select **Terminal(2)** > **New Terminal(3)**.

    ![](./Media/semtic-newterminal.png)

13. Execute the following commands to install the necessary packages.
    
    ```
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting --version 9.0.0-preview.3.24172.9
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Options.DataAnnotations --version 9.0.0-preview.3.24172.9
    dotnet add package Microsoft.SemanticKernel --version 1.11.0
    ```

    >**Note**: These commands are used in a .NET Core or .NET 5+ project to add NuGet packages to the project. Here's what each command does:

    > **dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting --version 9.0.0-preview.3.24172.9**: Adds the Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting package to the project with a specific version (9.0.0-preview.3.24172.9). This package provides hosting and startup abstractions for .NET applications.

    > **dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Options.DataAnnotations --version 9.0.0-preview.3.24172.9**: Adds the Microsoft.Extensions.Options.DataAnnotations package to the project with a specific version (9.0.0-preview.3.24172.9). This package extends the options framework in .NET to support data annotations for configuration objects.

    > **dotnet add package Microsoft.SemanticKernel --version 1.11.0**: Adds the Microsoft.SemanticKernel package to the project with a specific version (1.11.0). This package likely provides functionality related to semantic analysis and processing within the application.


14. To build and run the Home Automation application from the terminal use the following commands:

    ```powershell
    dotnet build
    dotnet run
    ```
    
    ![](./Media/dotnetbuild.png)

    > **Note**: Please disregard the warning.
    
    > **Note** The commands dotnet build and dotnet run are fundamental in .NET Core and .NET 5+ environments for building and running .NET applications locally on your machine.

15. After running `dotnet run`, you can ask few questions and review the response. For example: `What time is it?`

    ![](./Media/miyagi-image100.png)

16. Example 2: `Set an alarm for 6:00 am.`

    ![](./Media/miyagi-image101.png)

17. If you wish to include additional questions, navigate to the **worker.cs** file and insert your new questions at **line number 32**.

    ![](./Media/miyagi-image102.png)

18. Alternatively, you can pose any question to in the terminal.

### Task 2: Configure Azure Cognitive Search

In this task, you'll configure Azure Cognitive Search by importing data from CosmosDB into a search index named "realestate-us-sample-index". You customize the index and create an indexer named "realestate-us-sample-indexer" to synchronize data. Finally, you verify the search functionality by querying data for "Seattle".

1. Navigate back to the **Azure portal** tab, in Search resources, services and docs (G+/) box at the top of the portal, enter **AI Search**, and then select **AI Search** under services.

    ![](./Media/miyagi-image25.png)

1. In **Azure AI services | AI Search** tab, select **acs-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

    ![](./Media/miyagi-image26.png)

1. In the overiew tab of search service, click on the **Import data**.

    ![](./Media/miyagi-image103.png)
   
1. From the drop-down select **Data Source** as **Sample (1)**, select the **CosmosDB hotels-sample (2)**, and click on **Next : Add cognitive skills(optional) (3)**.

   ![](./Media/miyagi-image104.png)
   
1. In **cognitive skills** leave as default and click on **Customize target index**.

    ![](./Media/miyagi-image105.png)
   
1. In the **Customize target index**, Enter the index name as **realestate-us-sample-index** and click on **Next:Create an indexer**.

   ![](./Media/miyagi-image106.png)
   
1. In the **create an indexer**, change the indexer name as **realestate-us-sample-indexer** and click on **submit**.

   ![](./Media/miyagi-image107.png)

1. Navigate back to **Azure AI services | AI Search** tab, select **acs-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

   ![](./Media/miyagi-image26.png)
   
1. From the left navigation pane under **Search management** select **Indexes (1)** and click on **realestate-us-sample-index (2)**.

1. ![](./Media/miyagi-image108.png)

1. Click on **realestate-us-sample-index** in the search bar enter **Seattle (1)** and click on **Search (2)** then view thw **Result (3)**.
